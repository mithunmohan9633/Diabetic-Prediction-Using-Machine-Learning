# Diabetic-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
Sure, here's This project predicts diabetes likelihood using machine learning, focusing on the Support Vector Machine (SVM) model. Utilizing the PIMA Indians Diabetes Dataset from Kaggle, it includes features like glucose levels, BMI, and age. The SVM model's performance is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
